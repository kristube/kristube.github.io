					<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Rube & I met at Wesley United Methodist Church’s youth group almost 12 years ago. After meeting, we briefly dated, but soon “we” decided we were better off as friends. And friends we remained until the summer of 2011 when Rube returned from his first Army deployment. We had a picnic at the Dallas Arboretum and listened to a Rolling Stones cover band on our “first date”. Things were different after that night and 6 months later in February of 2012 we began dating. The last 3 years have been a lot of fun and we can't wait to get married so we can continue the fun for the rest of our lives!</p>
